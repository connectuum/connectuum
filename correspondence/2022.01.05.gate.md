this path you lay \
it fascinates \
_gratitude_ to you \
for such effort

i saw a gap \
that perhaps \
riddled, i could fill \
for what it's worth:

> Perhaps most strange of all is that this word is **also translated as `dead`** on several occasions.
>
> `...`
>
> It becomes incredibly confusing to attempt to reconcile each of these definitions to one root, and especially confusing to understand how each of these ideas should be applicable to one group of ancient people, incorporating both the ideas of something `dead`:
> * a _ghost_
> * something feeble or _ethereal_
> * the concept of healing and _revitalizing_
> * while the definition of “_giant_” is thrown in, besides

On the seventh night, the _spirit of the depths_ spoke to me:

> look into your depths, \
> pray to your depths, \
> [_**waken the `dead`.**_](https://connectuum.github.io/redbook/liber-primus/3-on-the-service-of-the-soul.html#waken)

`...`

Did you not see that when your creative force **turned to the world,** how **the `dead` things moved** under it and through it, how they grew and prospered, and **how your thoughts flowed in rich rivers?** If your [creative force now _turns_](https://connectuum.github.io/redbook/liber-primus/4a-the-desert.html#enduring) to the **place of the soul,** you will see how your soul becomes green and how its field **bears wonderful fruit.**

`...`

My soul answered:

> [...] how can _you_ suffer from scorn \
if you address _me_ \
with those words that _i_ give you? \
do you know, then, \
**who _i_ am?**
>
> have you \
_grasped_ me, \
_defined_ me, \
and _made me_ \
[**into a `dead` formula?**](https://connectuum.github.io/redbook/liber-primus/4b-experiences-in-the-desert.html#vessel)

[...] I did not know that **I am your vessel,** empty without you, **but brimming over _with_ you.**

`...`

As the fate of the peoples is represented to you in _events,_ so will it happen _in your heart._ If the hero in you is slain, then the sun of the depths rises in you, [...] everything that, up til now, seemed to be `dead` in you [will come to `life`](https://connectuum.github.io/redbook/liber-primus/5-descent-into-hell-in-the-future.html#sacrifice).

`...`

Incapacity prevents further ascent. **Greater height requires greater virtue.** _We do not possess it._ We must first create it by learning to live with our incapacity. [We must give it `life`](https://connectuum.github.io/redbook/liber-primus/5-descent-into-hell-in-the-future.html#hero).

`...`

// in the Red Book: worldly words are a collapse from the image and path and Truth and Light and _infinite potential_ of `life`. worldly events and explanations and measurements and the past-and-has-been are all `dead`. we live in the realm of the `dead`, trapped in our serfdom. _but we can find our way out._

`dead` \
silent giant \
feeble in sleep \
wielder in waking \
of the terrible healing \
**here,** ghosts aghast \
compelled to _wait_ \
by the maker \
sleeping agents \
_until we wake_
